      <h1>Introduction</h1>
      <p>I am an artist! I draw and animate and work with my hands. Now I want to learn how to code and potentially make apps and video games!</p>
      <h1>Where I'm From</h1>
      <p>I'm from the Chicagoland area. I went to college in Californa, then moved back home.</p>
      <h1>What are your favorite hobbies?</h1>
      <p>I love to draw and craft. But my favorite ways to pass time is to watch anime/cartoons and movies. I also love to play tennis but I haven't played in a while!</p>
      <h1>What's your dream job?</h1>
      <p>My dream job is to own my own animation studio! But I really want it to be an entertainment studio, as I would love to make games and other forms of interactive media!</p>
      <h1>Where do you live?</h1>
      <p>In Evanston! I just got my own place earlier this year. It is an exciting time.</p>
      <h1>Why do you want to be a web developer?</h1>
      <p>The short of it is I would like a higher paying, more stable career. The long of it is that the world is becoming more and more tech based. I could do so much with my art and future business ventures if I know how to make my own websites, or apps, or just adding simple lines of code to make certain animations easier and more effiect to create. Learning to code seems like an efficent way to wrap up all my wants and a few needs.</p>
